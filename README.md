## 💻 Technical Stack
As a cybersecurity professional, I chose a **Static Architecture** for this portfolio to prioritize security and performance.

* **Frontend:** HTML5, CSS3 (No insecure JavaScript frameworks).
* **Architecture:** Jamstack (Static site, no database = zero SQL injection risk).
* **Security:** SSL/TLS encryption enforced via GitHub Pages & Cloudflare.
* **Hosting:** GitHub Pages (Version-controlled, highly resilient).

## 🎯 My Focus: SMB Security
Small businesses are often the most vulnerable. My mission is to bridge the gap between complex enterprise security and small business reality.

* **Network Audits:** Identifying misconfigurations in WiFi, IoT, and internal servers.
* **Compliance Guidance:** Navigating GDPR, HIPAA, and local data protection laws.
* **Risk Management:** Translating technical threats into business impact.
